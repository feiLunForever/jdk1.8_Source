/**
 * A package-local class holding common representation and mechanics
 * for classes supporting dynamic striping on 64bit values. The class
 * extends Number so that concrete subclasses must publicly do so.
 */
@SuppressWarnings("serial")
abstract class Striped64 extends Number {
    /*
     * This class maintains a lazily-initialized table of atomically
     * updated variables, plus an extra "base" field. The table size
     * is a power of two. Indexing uses masked per-thread hash codes.
     * Nearly all declarations in this class are package-private,
     * accessed directly by subclasses.
     *
     * Table entries are of class Cell; a variant of AtomicLong padded
     * (via @sun.misc.Contended) to reduce cache contention. Padding
     * is overkill for most Atomics because they are usually
     * irregularly scattered in memory and thus don't interfere much
     * with each other. But Atomic objects residing in arrays will
     * tend to be placed adjacent to each other, and so will most
     * often share cache lines (with a huge negative performance
     * impact) without this precaution.
     *
     * In part because Cells are relatively large, we avoid creating
     * them until they are needed.  When there is no contention, all
     * updates are made to the base field.  Upon first contention (a
     * failed CAS on base update), the table is initialized to size 2.
     * The table size is doubled upon further contention until
     * reaching the nearest power of two greater than or equal to the
     * number of CPUS. Table slots remain empty (null) until they are
     * needed.
     *
     * A single spinlock ("cellsBusy") is used for initializing and
     * resizing the table, as well as populating slots with new Cells.
     * There is no need for a blocking lock; when the lock is not
     * available, threads try other slots (or the base).  During these
     * retries, there is increased contention and reduced locality,
     * which is still better than alternatives.
     *
     * The Thread probe fields maintained via ThreadLocalRandom serve
     * as per-thread hash codes. We let them remain uninitialized as
     * zero (if they come in this way) until they contend at slot
     * 0. They are then initialized to values that typically do not
     * often conflict with others.  Contention and/or table collisions
     * are indicated by failed CASes when performing an update
     * operation. Upon a collision, if the table size is less than
     * the capacity, it is doubled in size unless some other thread
     * holds the lock. If a hashed slot is empty, and lock is
     * available, a new Cell is created. Otherwise, if the slot
     * exists, a CAS is tried.  Retries proceed by "double hashing",
     * using a secondary hash (Marsaglia XorShift) to try to find a
     * free slot.
     *
     * The table size is capped because, when there are more threads
     * than CPUs, supposing that each thread were bound to a CPU,
     * there would exist a perfect hash function mapping threads to
     * slots that eliminates collisions. When we reach capacity, we
     * search for this mapping by randomly varying the hash codes of
     * colliding threads.  Because search is random, and collisions
     * only become known via CAS failures, convergence can be slow,
     * and because threads are typically not bound to CPUS forever,
     * may not occur at all. However, despite these limitations,
     * observed contention rates are typically low in these cases.
     *
     * It is possible for a Cell to become unused when threads that
     * once hashed to it terminate, as well as in the case where
     * doubling the table causes no thread to hash to it under
     * expanded mask.  We do not try to detect or remove such cells,
     * under the assumption that for long-running instances, observed
     * contention levels will recur, so the cells will eventually be
     * needed again; and for short-lived ones, it does not matter.
